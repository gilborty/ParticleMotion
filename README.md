# ParticleMotion
A simple test program exploring simulating physics-based particle motion with SFML 2

Will be consistently updating this repo with new experiments with particle motion until I feel the need to make a new repository.

Typical build steps for CMake.

# Animation
Here is a very simple animation I made during the first experiment. I think this project has turned into an exercise on how to make .gifs correctly
